For updates, the Edit Video Page allows users to change a video's title or replace the file, with changes reflected across the app wherever the video is displayed.

For managing content, users can easily remove any uploaded video using the Delete Video feature. Deleted videos are immediately removed from the video list, Watch Video page, and profile, making content management simple and effective.
